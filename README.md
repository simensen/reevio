#Reevio - Bringing Blogging to Tent

[Reevio](https://reevio.tent.is "Reevio on Tent") is a self-hosted blogging platform based on the [Tent protocol](http://tent.io "Tent - The decentralized social web") that uses Tent's Essay post-types to share your content with the world.

##Features
Reevio is a blog-front end that anybody can download and install on their server. Reevio allows you to blog via your Tent server; it displays the Essay posts from your Tent server (for example, [^daniel.tent.is](https://daniel.tent.is "Daniel Siders, Tent co-founder") or [^jeena.net](https://jeena.net "Jeena, one of the first Tent self-hosters")) in a blog format so that anybody (permissions permitting) can read them with ease; it also has a single-Essay view so your readers can focus on just one post. Reevio also provides your readers an RSS feed for your Essay posts, as well as details from your profile and a stream of your latest status posts in the sidebar and on the profile page.
